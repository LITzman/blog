I assume most people don&rsquo;t know how to bake good cookies, me neither.
If you do know how to make cookies, skedaddle out of here before I embarrass myself.
In my experience, baking is the kind of art that doesn&rsquo;t reward expermintation much - Smarter people make recipes, we follow them.
If we fuck up the recipe, they will fuck up our cookies.">

<p>I assume most people don&rsquo;t know how to bake good cookies, me neither.</p>
<p>If you do know how to make cookies, skedaddle out of here before I embarrass myself.</p>
<p>In my experience, baking is the kind of art that doesn&rsquo;t reward expermintation much - Smarter people make recipes, we follow them.</p>
<p>If we fuck up the recipe, they will fuck up our cookies.</p>
<p>Yet I messed up with a few recipes, and I did it enough times to end up with what I would consider a Properâ„¢ cookie, the kind I would pay for.</p>
<p>Mind you: This recipe produces large, chewy cookies that are insanely sweet. If you have a problem with that you are welcome to fuck my cookies and find out.</p>
<h1 id="youll-need--">You&rsquo;ll need -</h1>
<ul>
<li>115 grams of butter (unsalted)</li>
<li>3/4 cup of <strong>dark</strong> brown sugar, not light brown</li>
<li>1/2 cup of white sugar</li>
<li>1 egg</li>
<li>1 teaspoon of vanilla extract</li>
<li>1 + 1/4 cups of flour</li>
<li>1/2 teaspoon of baking soda</li>
<li>100 grams of chopped <strong>dark</strong> chocolate. The kind you&rsquo;d want to eat, like 60%+ cocoa.</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="optinal--">Optinal -</h5>
<ul>
<li>Crushed Hazelnuts (See notes)</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="the-method--">The method -</h1>
<p>Get a bowl that is large enough to hold all this cholesterol mess, pour in the two types of sugar and stir to combine.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll need to brown the butter - heat it in a silver pan (to clearly tell the color) on low-medium heat and stir until brown stuff form, the liquid changed it&rsquo;s color, and the smell gets toasty. Immediately pour to the bowl and stir to combine.</p>
<p>Break the eggs in, remove the shells that fell to the bowl, stir to combine.</p>
<p>Pour in vanilla, flour and baking soda and stir after each until you have cement.</p>
<p>Chop the chocolate (Carefully, these instructions are written in blood) with a sharp knife to chip-sized chips, and combine with the cookie goo.</p>
<p>Taste the batter (blah blah raw eggs who gives a shit (I will die early)).</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll now shape exactly 16 balls (balls, not disks) from this batter and cool them in the fridge for 30 minutes (don&rsquo;t freeze).</p>
<p>Preheat your oven to 175-180 degrees while they chill (Or earlier if you use the shitty oven our homeowner left) and after they are done chilling space them equally on a baking tray lined with baking parchment.</p>
<p>The cookies will slightly expand due to ambitions of their own. If you reckon this maneuver by the cookies will result in a disaster, try baking them in batches. Make sure the oven is hot enough and the cookies are solid as they were after 30 minutes of chilling before each batch.</p>
<p>Bake the cookies for 13 minutes, until they look like a proper cookie but still too soft to be a cookie. As with you and me, time will harden them.</p>
<p>Wait for them to cool a little bit, I guess 1 30 minutes or so for a soft, fresh bite or a bit longer for a room-temperature cookie.</p>
<h1 id="ways-to-fuck-the-cookie--">Ways to fuck the cookie -</h1>
<p>Assuming general tomfoolery (and not malicious intent), fucking up the recipe generally results in a cookie that is&hellip;</p>
<h4 id="too-crunchy"><strong>Too crunchy!</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Too much white sugar / Too little brown sugar</li>
<li>Too much time in the oven</li>
<li>Oven temperature too high</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="too-chewy"><strong>Too chewy</strong>!</h4>
<ul>
<li>Too much brown sugar / Too little white sugar</li>
<li>Too little time in the oven</li>
<li>Oven temperature too low</li>
<li>Cookies are frozen too hard before baking</li>
<li>Too much baking soda</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="too-thin"><strong>Too thin!</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Cookies did not chill enough</li>
<li>Too little baking soda / chocolate</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="too-thick"><strong>Too thick!</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Too much baking soda</li>
<li>Too much direct heat (Baking tray shouldn&rsquo;t be hot before baking)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="a-note-about-nuts--">A note about nuts -</h3>
<p>The only aspect of these cookies I got mixed reviews about was the inclusion of hazelnuts.</p>
<p>I believe that nuts can give an &ldquo;earthy&rdquo; vibe that can complement sweets.</p>
<p>I also believe that no nut should touch my cookies but hazelnuts. Please don&rsquo;t even try.</p>
<p>If you wish to include hazelnuts in your batch you&rsquo;ll need to lightly roast them - roast too hard and the nuts will burn while the cookies are baking.</p>
<p>They can be roasted in the oven, and I also discovered that air fryer (No oil, &ldquo;Roast&rdquo; setting) works surprisingly well for this purpose (and this purpose only).</p>
<p>Something like 7 minutes on 180-ish degrees should do.</p>
<p>You should put about 30-50 grams in your batch. This isn&rsquo;t alot, but the chocolate needs to dominate the cookie.</p>
<p><strong>Happy baking.</strong></p>
