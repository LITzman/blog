<h3 id="this-cake-is-fun">This cake is fun</h3>
<p>This recipe calls for <strong>a lot</strong> of butter and chocolate, but no flour - Bitch is gluten free!<br>
If this cake was promised to you 3000 years ago, you will be happy to know it&rsquo;s kosher, even for Passover.<br>
Even though it has some annoying maneuvers involved, this journey will take about 90~ minutes until completion and about 1 more hour until the cake is edible.</p>
<h3 id="special-tools-you-will-need">Special tools you will need</h3>
<ul>
<li>Round spring-form cake pan (10&quot;?)</li>
<li>Aluminum foil</li>
<li>Deep baking pan</li>
<li>10 mm Wrench</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="cake-components">Cake components</h3>
<ul>
<li>250g of plain dark chocolate (can only hope for 60% cocoa)</li>
<li>225g of butter + some more</li>
<li>5 eggs</li>
<li>100g of caster sugar + 1 tbsp + some more</li>
<li>1 tbsp of cocoa powder + some more</li>
<li>2 tsp of vanilla essence</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-method">The methodâ„¢</h3>
<p>Fill your oven baking pan (not the spring-form one) with water - The cake will have to sit in these water so fill it as much as you can without it overflowing and messing your oven.<br>
Put it in the oven and preheat to 170 degrees.<br>
We will put the cake only when the oven and the water are hot enough!<br>
Prepare the cake pan - cover the bottom of the pan with baking sheet and cover the entire perimeter of the pan with aluminum foil so water won&rsquo;t leak inside.<br>
Grease the pan with some butter from all directions, uniformly sprinkle some sugar and dust of the excess.<br>
Now we can start baking.</p>
<p>Chop the chocolate, cut the butter into cubes and put all into a saucepan.<br>
Melt on a very low heat until smooth while stirring.<br>
Do use a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/c3cgJBT3T7E">double boiler</a> if you don&rsquo;t trust yourself to not burn the chocolate.</p>
<p>In a separate bowl, big enough to contain all the ingredients, beat the eggs and 100g of sugar for a minute with an electric mixer (Or a bit longer with your sexy strong arms, but beat them like really fast and hard)<br>
Mix the cocoa and the last tbsp of sugar in and blend well, and than the vanilla extract and blend well again.</p>
<p>Pour the mixture into the prepared pan and tap away all the bubbles.<br>
Licking the remainders of the batter left on the spoon and bowl is only allowed <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Worldwide-geographic-distribution-of-Salmonella-geo-serotypes-n-1-472-The_fig2_303380705">outside the US, Germany and the UK</a>.</p>
<p>Now comes the tricky part - You need to place cake into the (hopefully hot enough) water pan in the oven.<br>
Use protective equipment, call a friend or something, I don&rsquo;t know, just get it done without spilling boiling water everywhere.</p>
<p>Bake for 45-50 minutes - The cake should rise slightly and have some pretty cracks on the top.</p>
<p>Call your friend again, It&rsquo;s time to take the cake out of the water.<br>
Place it on a rack and do your best to release the sides of the cake pan so the cake will cool evenly.<br>
Try not to mess with it to much until it reaches room temperature.</p>
<p>After it completely cools, flip the cake onto a serving plate and release the baking sheet.<br>
Dust the top with cocoa powder and decorate as you see fit.<br>
The book calls for dark chocolate shavings on the sides, which sounds lovely.</p>
<p>Cut and serve!</p>
<p>Hope you had fun :)</p>
