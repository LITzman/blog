Eventually I'll write something about software or music or something I actually do and than my 3 readers will forsake me.\
Until then, another sugar infused recipe!

This recipe isn't mine. It's from a book that I can't find online so this page exists mostly for future preservation.


### This cake is fun
This recipe calls for **a lot** of butter and chocolate, but no flour - Bitch is gluten free!\
If this cake was promised to you 3000 years ago, you will be happy to know it's kosher, even for Passover.\
Even though it has some annoying maneuvers involved, this journey will take about 90~ minutes until completion and about 1 more hour until the cake is edible.


### Special tools you will need
 - Round spring-form cake pan (10"?)
 - Aluminum foil
 - Deep baking pan 
 - 10 mm Wrench


### Cake components
 - 250g of plain dark chocolate (can only hope for 60% cocoa)
 - 225g of butter + some more
 - 5 eggs
 - 100g of caster sugar + 1 tbsp + some more
 - 1 tbsp of cocoa powder + some more
 - 2 tsp of vanilla essence


### The methodâ„¢
Fill your oven baking pan (not the spring-form one) with water - The cake will have to sit in these water so fill it as much as you can without it overflowing and messing your oven.\
Put it in the oven and preheat to 170 degrees.\
We will put the cake only when the oven and the water are hot enough!\
Prepare the cake pan - cover the bottom of the pan with baking sheet and cover the entire perimeter of the pan with aluminum foil so water won't leak inside.\
Grease the pan with some butter from all directions, uniformly sprinkle some sugar and dust of the excess.\
Now we can start baking.

Chop the chocolate, cut the butter into cubes and put all into a saucepan.\
Melt on a very low heat until smooth while stirring.\
Do use a [double boiler](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/c3cgJBT3T7E) if you don't trust yourself to not burn the chocolate.

In a separate bowl, big enough to contain all the ingredients, beat the eggs and 100g of sugar for a minute with an electric mixer (Or a bit longer with your sexy strong arms, but beat them like really fast and hard)\
Mix the cocoa and the last tbsp of sugar in and blend well, and than the vanilla extract and blend well again.

Pour the mixture into the prepared pan and tap away all the bubbles.\
Licking the remainders of the batter left on the spoon and bowl is only allowed [outside the US, Germany and the UK](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Worldwide-geographic-distribution-of-Salmonella-geo-serotypes-n-1-472-The_fig2_303380705).

Now comes the tricky part - You need to place cake into the (hopefully hot enough) water pan in the oven.\
Use protective equipment, call a friend or something, I don't know, just get it done without spilling boiling water everywhere.

Bake for 45-50 minutes - The cake should rise slightly and have some pretty cracks on the top.

Call your friend again, It's time to take the cake out of the water.\
Place it on a rack and do your best to release the sides of the cake pan so the cake will cool evenly.\
Try not to mess with it to much until it reaches room temperature.

After it completely cools, flip the cake onto a serving plate and release the baking sheet.\
Dust the top with cocoa powder and decorate as you see fit.\
The book calls for dark chocolate shavings on the sides, which sounds lovely.

Cut and serve!

Hope you had fun :)
